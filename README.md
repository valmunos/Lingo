# Lingo
Jupyter notebook and script to play a word-guessing game I built.  The lingo.py file contains the functions you need to play the game, and words.txt is your dictionary.  

Made this for a programming class in my (pre) Master's program.  Probably done making changes to it, but who knows. Will upload more stuff later on.
